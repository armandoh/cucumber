cucumber
========

This repository contains some projects for behaviour driven development using "Cucumber" tool.

Cucumber lets software development teams describe how software should behave in plain text. 
The text is written in a business-readable domain-specific language and serves as documentation, automated tests and development-aid - all rolled into one format.


Cucumber can work with Java, Ruby, .NET, Flex or web applications written in any language.

In this repository the projects will combine Cucumber + Java + Gradle, using IntelliJ as main IDE.
